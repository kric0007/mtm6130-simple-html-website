            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>At <em>Whisker & Tail</em>, we believe pets are more than just companions - they are family. That belief
                inspires everything we do, from carefully selecting natural, high-quality products to support pet
                parents with expert guidance and genuine care. Weather it's a wagging tail, a gentle purr, or a chirp
                from the cage, we're here to help you return that unconditional love.</p>
            <p>Our journey started with a simple mission: to create a pet store that puts animals' well-being first.
                That means offering thoughtfully sourced food, toys that are as <b>safe</b> as they are <b>fun</b>, and
                grooming supplies that keep pets happy and healthy. We don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions -
                <em>every</em> pet is unique, and we're proud to support a wide range of needs.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond products, we're committed to building a community that celebrates the bond between humans and
                animals. We work with local shelters, listen to our costumers, and are constantly learning how to serve
                pets better. Here, we're more than a store - we're your partner in care, comfort and joy for every paw,
                feather, and fin in your life.</p>
